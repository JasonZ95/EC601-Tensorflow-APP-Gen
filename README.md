# Dataset
Stanford prepared the Tiny ImageNet dataset for their CS231n course. The dataset spans 200 image classes with 500 training examples per class. The dataset also has 50 validation and 50 test examples per class.

The images are down-sampled to 64x64 pixels vs. 256x256 for the original ImageNet. The full ImageNet dataset also has 1000 classes.

Tiny ImageNet is large enough to be a challenging and realistic problem. But not so big as to require days of training before you see results.
